# London Bike Rides
Following the steps of Mo Chen (@mochen862), the main goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard in order to visualize data on bike rides in London,  between 2015-2017, showing: the total and the moving average of bike rides in a pre-selected time interval, as well as a heatmap of temperature vs. wind speed for the same period.

The file london_bike_rides.ipynb contains the python code, developed on google colab.
